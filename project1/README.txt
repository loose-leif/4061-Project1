Purpose of the Program:
	The purpose of our program is to create an autonomous execution program that can 
   complete multiple complicated tasks that are dependant on others. 

How to Compile the Program:
	Just run the makefile in the source file to compile the program.

What Our Program Does:
	Our program takes a given input file, which consists of a number of total nodes,
   a list of commands to add to the nodes and a directed graph, and will output the executed
   commands to a seperate output file. These commands will be sorted by the order determined by
   the depth first search program. Our program will even print the process id next to each 
   executed command in the output file. 

Assumptions:
	1. Commands in the input file are valid commands
